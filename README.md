# Experiment Factory Experiment

 - [JsPsych base](https://jspsych.org) base
 - [Experiment Factory](https://expfactory.github.io) ready
 - [Open Bases](https://openbases.github.io) deploy and publish option

Hi Friend! This is a [jspsych base](https://jspsych.org) for an Experiment that is friendly for use in the [Experiment Factory](https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory), and optionally reproducibly deploy and publish with [Open Bases](https://openbases.github.io). You can run it locally by putting these files in a web server, or use the Experiment Factory to generate a reproducible container. Check out the documentation above for more information, or [post an issue](https://www.github.com/expfactory/expfactory/issues) if you have any questions.
